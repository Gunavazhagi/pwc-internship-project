# PWC-internship-project

## PWC-PowerBI-Virtualcase:
The internship provides an opportunity for students and aspiring professionals to gain hands-on experience and develop practical skills in using Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool.So I decided to delve into this program and get exposure to a reputable professional services firm like PwC, especially in the Data field. The program is divided into 4 tasks that Iâ€™m sharing here.
    1.Introduction
    2.Call Centre Trends
    3.Customer retention 
    4.Diversity and Inclusion

# Task 1: Introduction:
The first task is fill out a little text field and set the mood to start our experience in PowerBI. Where I shared my curiosity to learn and excitement to work on this virtual internships, my expectations from it, exposure to how top companies work in the field of data.

# Task 2: Call Centre Trends:

## Problem Context
Claire, our client, needs a comprehensive and visually appealing dashboard in Power BI to monitor and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics from a dataset. This dashboard will help Claire and her team gain valuable insights into their business operations, make informed decisions, and track their performance over time.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard that provides Claire with a clear overview of important KPIs and metrics. The dashboard should allow Claire to:
  1.Monitor overall customer satisfaction levels.
  2.Track the number of calls answered and abandoned.
  3.Analyze call volumes by time, helping identify peak hours.
  4.Calculate the average speed of answer to assess responsiveness.
  5.Evaluate agent performance based on the average handle time (talk duration) and calls answered.

## KPIs and Metrices
Here are some of the key performance indicators and metrics that we aim to include in the dashboard:

  1.**Overall Customer Satisfaction:** This metric reflects the satisfaction level of customers, which is crucial for understanding the quality of service.
  2.**Overall Calls Answered/Abandoned:** Monitoring the number of calls answered and abandoned helps in assessing call center efficiency.
  3.**Calls by Time:** Visualizing call volumes by different time periods (e.g., hourly, daily, or weekly) can reveal patterns and trends.
  4.**Average Speed of Answer:** This metric measures the average time it takes to answer incoming calls, indicating how quickly customers are attended to.
  5.**Agent's Performance Quadrant:** We will create a quadrant chart that plots average handle time (talk duration) against calls answered. This chart helps identify high-performing agents.

# Task 3: Customer Retention

## Problem Context

The objective of this task is to define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) relevant to monitoring customer retention and churn. Subsequently, we aim to design a dashboard that effectively visualizes these KPIs to assist the retention manager in making informed decisions.

## Defining KPIs

To define appropriate KPIs, it's essential to consider factors directly influencing customer retention. Some potential KPIs to consider (but not limited to) include:

- **Churn Rate:** The percentage of customers who stop using your product or service within a specific period.
  
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Predicted net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer.

- **Retention Rate:** The percentage of customers who continue using your product or service within a specific period.

- **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):** A metric measuring customer satisfaction with your product or service.

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** A metric assessing customer loyalty and their willingness to recommend your product or service to others.

## Visualization

We will use Power BI to create a dashboard that visualizes these KPIs effectively. The key visualizations when presenting findings will include:

1. Percentage of Churned Customers
2. Average Tenure
3. Total Ticket Count
4. Churn Rate by Gender
5. Customer Distribution by Internet and Phone Service
6. Churn Rate by Payment Method
7. Ticket Creation by Payment Method
8. Contract Distribution with Monthly Charges
9. Total Charges Accumulation by Tenure

These visualizations will provide a comprehensive view of customer retention and churn patterns, helping the retention manager gain valuable insights into the customer base.

# Task 4: Diversity and Inclusion

## Problem Context

In the context of human resources (HR) and talent management, it is essential to measure and monitor various key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess workforce diversity, performance, and retention. In this project, our aim is to calculate specific HR metrics to help define meaningful KPIs.

## HR Metrics and KPIs

The following measures are crucial for understanding the HR landscape and defining meaningful KPIs:

**Workforce Composition:**
- *Number of Men:* This measure provides insights into the gender distribution within the organization.
- *Number of Women:* Similarly, tracking the number of women in the workforce is essential for gender diversity analysis.
- *Number of Leavers:* Calculating the number of employees who have left the organization is critical for measuring turnover.

**Promotions:**
- *Percentage of Employees Promoted (FY21):* This KPI indicates the rate of internal promotions within the organization during the fiscal year 2021.
- *Percentage of Women Promoted:* Specifically, the percentage of women promoted helps assess gender equality in career advancement.

**Turnover:**
- *Percentage of Turnover:* This KPI calculates the overall rate of employee turnover, helping to identify potential retention issues.

**Performance Ratings:**
- *Average Performance Rating - Men:* Evaluating the average performance rating for male employees provides insights into their overall performance.
- *Average Performance Rating - Women:* Similarly, assessing the average performance rating for female employees helps understand their performance levels.

## Visualization

To effectively present our findings, we will use Power BI to create a dashboard. Key visualizations in the dashboard will include:

1. Percentage of employees promoted
2. Percentage of women promoted
3. Percentage of men promoted
4. Number of male employees
5. Number of female employees
6. Number of leavers
7. Employee distribution by region
8. Employee distribution by department
9. Total FY20 performance rating by age
10. Turnover over time
11. Cumulative Rand analysis by job over time

These visualizations will provide valuable insights into our diversity and inclusion efforts, performance assessment, and retention strategies.
